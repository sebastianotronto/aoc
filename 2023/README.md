# Advent of Code 2023

This is my first year trying the AoC. I decided to use C because it is the
language I know the best and I am familiar with the standard library.

I did not write many comments, but if you are curious about my solutions
send me an email and I'll be happy to explain!

## Instructions

Compile with `-std=c99`. Day 6 requires also the `-lm` option to link with the
math library, that is

```
$ cc -std=c99 -lm 06/6a.c
```

My solutions read from stdin, so run the e.g. with

```
$ ./a.out <in.txt
```

## Personal times

Note: New problems come out at 6am in my time zone. At some point in
mid-December I started waking up early to try and solve the problem
before work, but I could not always do it. On the weekend of December
16-17 I was busy and I could not solve any problem at all. Regarding
day 21, I just found it very hard and could not finish it within a day.
