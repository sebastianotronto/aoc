# Advent of Code 2023

This is my first year trying the AoC. I decided to use C because it is the
language I know the best and I am familiar with the standard library.

## Instructions

Compile with `-std=c99` and other required options, for example

```
$ cc -std=c99 -lm 06/6a.c
```

My solutions read from stdin, so run the e.g. with

```
$ ./a.out <in.txt
```
