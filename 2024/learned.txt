List of things I learned (or refreshed) with this year's AoC.

* Day 1: std::count()
* Day 2: std::sstream
* Day 3: std::string_view
* Day 4: nothing special, some practice with classic and a weird trick
  to assign two variables at once with a pair of references pair<int&, int&>
* Day 5: std::find and std::replace
* Day 8: set::insert_range(), but it is from C++23 only
