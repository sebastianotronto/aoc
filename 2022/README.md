# Advent of Code 2022

I did not solve these problems in 2022, but in 2025, as a playground
to learn Rust.

## Usage

To run this code you'll need the `rustc` compiler (no `cargo`).

From this folder run: `./run.sh day part`, for example `./run.sh 03 a`.
Input is read from standard input; paste your input in the terminal or
read it from a file with e.g. `<input.txt`.
